# Quiz App Backend Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for completing the backend of the Quiz App project using FastAPI. The project aims to provide a comprehensive system for user account management, question set uploads, and dynamic learning tools.

## Development Roadmap

Below is a roadmap for the remaining development tasks, organized into checkbox format for easy tracking.

### User Account Management
- [ ] **JWT-based Authentication**: Implement JWT for secure user session management. This includes registration, login, and logout functionalities.
  - **Files involved**: `auth.py` (to be created), `models.py` (update user model), `dependencies.py` (for JWT token verification).
- [ ] **User Registration**: Allow new users to register by providing necessary details.
  - **Files involved**: `auth.py`, `schemas.py` (for user schema), `crud.py` (for database operations).
- [ ] **User Login and Logout**: Enable users to log in and securely log out.
  - **Files involved**: `auth.py`, `schemas.py`, `crud.py`.

### Question Set Management
- [ ] **Question Set Uploads**: Enable users to upload question sets in JSON format.
  - **Files involved**: `question_sets.py` (to be created), `models.py` (update for question set model), `schemas.py` (for question set schema).
- [ ] **Database Storage**: Use SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production to store question sets.
  - **Files involved**: `database.py` (configure databases), `models.py`.
- [ ] **Public/Private Question Sets**: Allow users to mark question sets as public or private.
  - **Files involved**: `question_sets.py`, `models.py`.

### Filtering and Randomization
- [ ] **Filtering Options**: Provide filtering capabilities for questions by subject, topic, subtopic, and status.
  - **Files involved**: `filters.py` (to be created), `models.py`.
- [ ] **Randomization Logic**: Implement logic to randomize questions and their answer choices.
  - **Files involved**: `randomization.py` (to be created).

### Response Tracking
- [ ] **Track User Answers**: Design a system to record user answers, including timestamps and correctness.
  - **Files involved**: `responses.py` (to be created), `models.py` (update for response model), `schemas.py` (for response schema).

### API Endpoints
- [ ] **RESTful Endpoints**: Develop endpoints for user management, question set CRUD operations, filtering, and response submissions.
  - **Files involved**: `main.py`, `auth.py`, `question_sets.py`, `filters.py`, `responses.py`.
- [ ] **Swagger Documentation**: Utilize FastAPI's Swagger UI to document these endpoints.
  - **Files involved**: Automatically generated by FastAPI, but ensure all endpoint functions have appropriate docstrings.

### Security Considerations
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Ensure all inputs are properly validated to prevent injection attacks.
  - **Files involved**: All endpoint-related files.
- [ ] **CORS Configuration**: Configure CORS appropriately to secure the API.
  - **Files involved**: `main.py`.

### Extra Features (Optional)
- [ ] **Scoring System**: Explore adding a scoring system or leaderboard.
  - **Files involved**: `scoring.py` (to be created), `models.py`, `schemas.py`.
- [ ] **Review Mode**: Implement a review mode for questions answered incorrectly.
  - **Files involved**: `review.py` (to be created), `models.py`.

## Setup and Running Guide

*This section will be filled out upon completion of the above tasks, detailing how to set up and run the backend system.*

# Directory: /code/quiz-app/quiz-app-backend/app/schemas

## File: README.md
```markdown
# Pydantic Schemas

This directory contains the Pydantic schemas for the Quiz App backend.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file is currently empty but serves as a placeholder to make the `schemas` directory a Python package.

- `questions.py`: This module defines the Pydantic schemas for the Question model. It includes the following schemas:
  - `QuestionBase`: The base schema for a Question, containing the `text` attribute.
  - `QuestionCreate`: The schema for creating a Question, inheriting from `QuestionBase`.
  - `Question`: The schema representing a stored Question, inheriting from `QuestionBase` and including additional attributes such as `id` and `subtopic_id`.

- `user.py`: This module defines the Pydantic schemas for the User model. It includes the following schemas:
  - `UserBase`: The base schema for a User, containing the `username` attribute.
  - `UserCreate`: The schema for creating a User, inheriting from `UserBase` and including the `password` attribute with validation.
  - `UserLogin`: The schema for user login, containing the `username` and `password` attributes.

## Suggestions

Given the goals of the Quiz App project outlined in `/code/quiz-app/quiz-app-backend/README.md`, here are some suggestions for additional schemas or considerations:

- Create schemas for other models such as `Subject`, `Topic`, `Subtopic`, `AnswerChoice`, and `UserResponse`. These schemas will define the structure and validation rules for the corresponding models.

- Consider creating separate schemas for different actions or use cases related to each model. For example, you may have separate schemas for creating, updating, and retrieving questions or user responses.

- If the quiz app supports different types of questions (e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank), you may need to create schemas for each question type to handle their specific attributes and validation rules.

- To support user authentication and authorization, consider creating schemas for user registration, user profile updates, and user roles or permissions.

- If the quiz app allows users to create and share their own question sets, you may need to create schemas for user-generated content such as `UserQuestionSet` or `UserQuestion`.

- As the quiz app evolves and new features are added, you may need to create additional schemas or modify existing ones to accommodate the new data structures and validation requirements.

Remember to keep the schemas modular, focused, and aligned with the corresponding models and API endpoints. Use appropriate data types, validation rules, and constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency.

Consider using Pydantic's advanced features such as field validators, custom data types, and schema inheritance to handle complex validation scenarios and maintain code reusability.

Regularly review and update the schemas as the application evolves to ensure they accurately represent the expected input and output data structures for the quiz app's API endpoints.

# CRUD Operations

This directory contains modules that provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for various entities in the Quiz App backend.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file is currently empty but serves as a placeholder to make the `crud` directory a Python package.

- `crud_question_sets.py`: This module provides CRUD operations for question sets. It includes the following functions:
  - `create_question_set(db: Session, question_set: QuestionSetCreate) -> QuestionSet`: Create a new question set.
  - `get_question_sets(db: Session, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100) -> List[QuestionSet]`: Retrieve a list of question sets.
  - `update_question_set(db: Session, question_set_id: int, question_set: QuestionSetUpdate) -> QuestionSet`: Update a question set.
  - `delete_question_set(db: Session, question_set_id: int) -> bool`: Delete a question set.

- `crud_user.py`: This module provides CRUD operations for users. It includes the following functions:
  - `create_user(db: Session, user: UserCreate) -> User`: Create a new user.
  - `get_user_by_username(db: Session, username: str) -> User`: Retrieve a user by username.
  - `authenticate_user(db: Session, username: str, password: str) -> User`: Authenticate a user.
  - `remove_user(db: Session, user_id: int) -> User`: Remove a user.

## Suggestions

Given the goals of the Quiz App project outlined in `/code/quiz-app/quiz-app-backend/README.md`, here are some suggestions for additional files or purposes of empty files in this directory:

- Consider creating separate CRUD modules for other entities such as subjects, topics, subtopics, and user responses. This would provide a more modular and organized approach to handle CRUD operations for each entity.

- The empty `__init__.py` file serves as a placeholder to make the `crud` directory a Python package. It can be used to import and re-export the CRUD functions from the individual modules, providing a cleaner and more convenient way to access them from other parts of the application.

- As the project grows, you may need to add more CRUD operations or extend the existing ones to support additional functionality or filtering options. Keep the CRUD modules focused on database operations and separate the business logic and validation into separate service or utility modules.

- Consider adding error handling and proper error responses in the CRUD functions to handle scenarios such as invalid data, resource not found, or database errors. This will help in providing meaningful error messages to the API consumers.

- If there are common database queries or operations that are used across multiple CRUD modules, consider extracting them into a separate utility module to avoid duplication and promote code reuse.

Remember to keep the CRUD modules simple, focused, and maintainable. They should only be responsible for performing database operations, while the business logic and validation should be handled in separate layers of the application.

# Tests

This directory contains the test files for the Quiz App backend.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file is currently empty but serves as a placeholder to make the `tests` directory a Python package.

- `conftest.py`: This module defines pytest fixtures for testing the Quiz App backend. It includes fixtures for creating a test database session, a FastAPI test client, and a test user.

- `test_auth.py`: This module contains tests for user authentication. It covers scenarios such as successful authentication, failed authentication, and authentication with missing credentials.

- `test_registration.py`: This module contains tests for user registration. It covers scenarios such as successful registration, registration with existing username, registration with invalid data, and registration with empty data.

## Suggestions

Given the goals of the Quiz App project outlined in `/code/quiz-app/quiz-app-backend/README.md`, here are some suggestions for additional test files or considerations:

- Create test files for other API endpoints and functionality, such as question management, user responses, filtering, and randomization. These tests should cover various scenarios, including success cases, error handling, and edge cases.

- Consider creating separate test files for different models and CRUD operations. For example, you may have `test_questions.py`, `test_subjects.py`, `test_user_responses.py`, etc., to test the functionality related to each model.

- If the quiz app supports different types of questions (e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank), create test files to cover the specific behavior and validation for each question type.

- Write tests for user authentication and authorization, including token generation, token validation, and access control for protected endpoints.

- Create integration tests to verify the interaction between different components of the backend, such as the API endpoints, database operations, and external services (if any).

- Consider writing tests for edge cases, error scenarios, and input validation to ensure the robustness and reliability of the backend.

- If the quiz app has complex business logic or algorithms (e.g., question randomization, scoring), create separate test files to thoroughly test those components.

- As new features or modifications are introduced to the backend, make sure to update the existing tests and add new tests to cover the changes.

Remember to follow best practices for testing, such as using meaningful test names, maintaining test independence, and covering both positive and negative scenarios.

Regularly run the test suite to ensure that the backend functionality remains intact and to catch any regressions or bugs introduced by code changes.

Consider integrating the tests into your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automatically run the tests whenever changes are made to the codebase.

Keep the tests maintainable, readable, and up to date with the evolving requirements of the quiz app backend.

# Directory: /code/quiz-app/quiz-app-backend/app/db

## File: README.md
```markdown
# Database Management

This directory contains modules related to database management and session handling for the Quiz App backend.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file is currently empty but serves as a placeholder to make the `db` directory a Python package.

- `base_class.py`: This module defines the base class for SQLAlchemy models. It provides a declarative base class (`Base`) that can be used to create database models.

- `session.py`: This module provides database session management. It includes the following:
  - `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL`: A variable that holds the database connection URL. It is currently set to use SQLite for development, but it should be adjusted for production.
  - `engine`: A SQLAlchemy engine instance created using the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL`.
  - `SessionLocal`: A SQLAlchemy session factory created using the `engine`.
  - `init_db() -> None`: A function that initializes the database by creating all the tables defined in the models.
  - `get_db() -> SessionLocal`: A function that creates a new database session and closes it when the request is finished. It is typically used as a dependency in FastAPI routes to provide a database session to the route handlers.

## Suggestions

Given the goals of the Quiz App project outlined in `/code/quiz-app/quiz-app-backend/README.md`, here are some suggestions for additional files or purposes of empty files in this directory:

- Consider adding a configuration file (e.g., `config.py`) to store database-related configuration settings, such as the database connection URL, database driver, and any additional database-specific settings. This file can be used to centralize the database configuration and make it easier to switch between different database systems or environments.

- If the project requires database migrations, you can add a migrations directory (e.g., `migrations/`) to store the migration files. Tools like Alembic can be used to manage database migrations, allowing you to version control your database schema and easily apply changes to the database.

- If there are common database queries or operations that are used across multiple parts of the application, consider creating a separate module (e.g., `queries.py`) to store these reusable queries. This module can provide a centralized place for defining and organizing commonly used database queries, improving code reusability and maintainability.

- As the project grows and the database schema becomes more complex, you may want to consider splitting the models into separate files based on their entity or domain. This can help keep the model definitions organized and easier to manage.

- If the application requires custom database types or extensions, you can create separate modules (e.g., `custom_types.py`) to define and register these custom types with SQLAlchemy.

Remember to keep the database-related modules focused on database management, session handling, and model definitions. Business logic and data manipulation should be handled in separate layers of the application, such as in the CRUD modules or service layers.

## File: README.md

# API Package

This directory contains the modules and packages related to the API functionality of the Quiz App backend.

## Directories

- `endpoints/`: This directory contains the implementation of various API endpoints for the Quiz App backend. Each file within this directory defines specific routes and handles the corresponding functionality.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file serves as the main entry point for the API package. It can be used to perform any necessary initialization or configuration for the API package.

## Suggestions

- Consider creating subdirectories within the `api/` directory to organize different aspects of the API functionality. For example:
  - `middleware/`: This directory could contain custom middleware classes for request processing, authentication, error handling, etc.
  - `dependencies/`: This directory could contain dependency classes or functions that are commonly used across multiple endpoints.
  - `utils/`: This directory could contain utility modules or helper functions specific to the API functionality.

- If the API package grows in complexity, consider splitting it into smaller, more focused packages to maintain a clear separation of concerns and improve code organization.

- Continuously update and maintain the API documentation in the `endpoints/` directory to ensure it remains accurate and up to date with any changes or additions to the API functionality.

- Implement thorough error handling and logging mechanisms to aid in debugging and monitoring the API's behavior in production.

- Consider implementing API versioning to allow for backward compatibility and smooth transitions when introducing breaking changes to the API.

- Explore the possibility of integrating API testing tools or frameworks to ensure the reliability and correctness of the API endpoints.

- Stay up to date with the latest best practices, security measures, and performance optimizations related to API development to ensure a robust and secure API implementation.

# API Endpoints

This directory contains the implementation of various API endpoints for the Quiz App backend.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file serves as a central point to import and organize the various endpoint routers. It imports the router objects from each endpoint file and makes them available for use in the main FastAPI application.

- `authentication.py`: This file provides endpoints for user registration and authentication. It defines routes for user registration (`/register/`) and issuing access tokens upon successful authentication (`/token/`).

- `questions.py`: This file provides endpoints for managing question sets. It defines routes for uploading question sets in JSON format (`/upload-questions/`) and retrieving question sets from the database (`/question-set/`).

- `register.py`: This file provides an endpoint for user registration. It defines a route for registering new users (`/register/`) by validating the provided data and creating a new user in the database.

- `token.py`: This file provides an endpoint for user authentication and token generation. It defines a route for authenticating users and issuing access tokens (`/token`) upon successful authentication.

- `users.py`: This file provides a simple endpoint for retrieving user information. It defines a route for retrieving a list of users (`/users/`), which is currently hardcoded.

## Suggestions

- Consider creating separate files for each major endpoint category (e.g., `users.py`, `questions.py`, `auth.py`) to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.

- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on questions, subjects, topics, and subtopics to allow for management of the quiz content.

- Add endpoints for retrieving user-specific data, such as user profiles, quiz history, and scores.

- Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting functionality for endpoints that return lists of data to improve performance and usability.

- Consider implementing rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage.

- Explore the possibility of implementing real-time features, such as live quizzes or multiplayer functionality, using WebSocket endpoints.

- Continuously update and maintain the API documentation to ensure it remains accurate and up to date with any changes or additions to the endpoints.

# Directory: /code/quiz-app/quiz-app-backend/app/models

## File: README.md
```markdown
# Database Models

This directory contains the database models for the Quiz App backend.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file is currently empty but serves as a placeholder to make the `models` directory a Python package.

- `answer_choices.py`: This module defines the `AnswerChoice` model, which represents an answer choice for a question in the quiz app.

- `questions.py`: This module defines the `Question` model, which represents a question in the quiz app.

- `subjects.py`: This module defines the `Subject` model, which represents a subject in the quiz app.

- `subtopics.py`: This module defines the `Subtopic` model, which represents a subtopic in the quiz app.

- `topics.py`: This module defines the `Topic` model, which represents a topic in the quiz app.

- `user_responses.py`: This module defines the `UserResponse` model, which represents a user's response to a question in the quiz app.

- `users.py`: This module defines the `User` model, which represents a user in the quiz app.

## Suggestions

Given the goals of the Quiz App project outlined in `/code/quiz-app/quiz-app-backend/README.md`, here are some suggestions for additional models or considerations:

- Consider adding a `QuestionSet` model to represent a set of questions that can be grouped together for a specific quiz or learning session. This model could have a many-to-many relationship with the `Question` model, allowing questions to be reused across different question sets.

- If the quiz app supports different types of questions (e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank), you may want to introduce a `QuestionType` model to represent the different question types. The `Question` model can then have a foreign key referencing the associated question type.

- To support user progress tracking and personalized learning, consider adding models such as `UserProgress` or `LearningPath` to store information about a user's progress through different subjects, topics, or question sets.

- If the quiz app allows users to create and share their own question sets, you may need to introduce models like `UserQuestionSet` or `UserQuestion` to represent user-generated content and establish the necessary relationships with the user model.

- To support additional features like leaderboards or achievements, consider adding models such as `Leaderboard`, `Achievement`, or `UserAchievement` to store the relevant data and establish the required relationships.

- As the quiz app grows and evolves, you may need to introduce additional models or modify existing ones to accommodate new features or requirements. Keep the models modular, focused, and aligned with the application's domain and business logic.

Remember to maintain clear and consistent naming conventions for the models and their attributes. Use appropriate data types and constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency.

When defining relationships between models, consider the cardinality and directionality of the relationships carefully. Use appropriate relationship types (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) and configure the necessary foreign keys and relationship properties.

Regularly review and update the models as the application evolves to ensure they accurately represent the data structure and relationships required by the quiz app.

# Core Package

This directory contains the core modules and functionality for the Quiz App backend.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file serves as the main entry point for the core package. It can be used to perform any necessary initialization or configuration for the core package.

- `auth.py`: This file provides authentication-related functionality for the Quiz App backend. It defines the OAuth2 authentication scheme and can be extended to include additional authentication mechanisms or utilities.

- `config.py`: This file provides configuration settings for the Quiz App backend. It can be used to define and manage various configuration options, such as database settings, API keys, or other environment-specific variables.

- `jwt.py`: This file provides JWT (JSON Web Token) related functionality for the Quiz App backend. It includes functions for creating and verifying JWT access tokens, as well as managing token expiration and other JWT-related operations.

- `security.py`: This file provides security-related utilities for the Quiz App backend. It includes functions for password hashing and verification using the bcrypt algorithm.

## Suggestions

- Consider adding more granular configuration options in the `config.py` file to allow for better customization and flexibility of the backend settings.

- Implement additional authentication mechanisms, such as API key authentication or social login, to provide multiple ways for users to authenticate with the backend.

- Explore the use of refresh tokens in addition to access tokens to enhance security and provide a better user experience for long-lived sessions.

- Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms in the core package to protect against excessive or abusive requests to the backend.

- Consider adding logging functionality to the core package to capture important events, errors, and metrics for monitoring and debugging purposes.

- Regularly update and maintain the dependencies used in the core package to ensure the latest security patches and bug fixes are applied.

- Implement robust error handling and exception management in the core package to provide meaningful error responses to clients and maintain the stability of the backend.

- Continuously review and improve the security measures implemented in the core package to protect against common vulnerabilities and threats.
