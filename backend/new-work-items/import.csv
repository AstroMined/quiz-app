Epic,Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation,,,,"<p>Implement a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions dynamically. This involves middleware, database models, schemas, CRUD functions, and endpoints for managing roles and permissions.</p>",New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 4,1,XL,RBAC; backend; security,"<p>Middleware for dynamic permission checks implemented, roles and permissions stored in the database, CRUD functions and endpoints available for managing roles and permissions.</p>"
Feature,,Authorization Middleware,,,"<p>Develop an AuthorizationMiddleware to handle dynamic permission checks for each request, based on user roles and the requested route and HTTP method.</p>",New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 4,1,L,middleware; security; permissions,"<p>Middleware intercepts requests and checks permissions based on route and method, raises HTTP 403 if the user lacks required permissions.</p>"
User Story,,,Dynamic Role and Permission Management,,"<p>Implement a system to store roles and permissions in the database, allowing dynamic management of roles and permissions without modifying the codebase.</p>",New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 4,1,L,roles; permissions; database,"<p>Roles and permissions stored in the database, CRUD functions and endpoints available for managing them.</p>"
Task,,,,Create Role and Permission Models,"<p>Create database models for roles and permissions, including fields for name and description. Establish a many-to-many relationship between RoleModel and PermissionModel.</p>",New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 4,1,M,models; database,"<p>RoleModel and PermissionModel with appropriate fields and relationships created in the database.</p>"
Task,,,,Implement CRUD Functions for Roles and Permissions,"<p>Develop CRUD functions to create, read, update, and delete roles and permissions in the database. Ensure these functions are accessible through corresponding endpoints.</p>",New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 5,2,M,CRUD; database,"<p>Functions to create, read, update, and delete roles and permissions implemented and accessible through API endpoints.</p>"
Task,,,,Create Schemas for Roles and Permissions,"<p>Develop serialization and deserialization schemas for roles and permissions to ensure data integrity and validation during CRUD operations.</p>",New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 5,2,M,schemas; serialization,"<p>RoleSchema and PermissionSchema created and integrated with CRUD functions for roles and permissions.</p>"
Task,,,,Centralized Configuration for Permissions,"<p>Store route-permission mappings in a configuration file or database, allowing updates to permissions without changing the application code.</p>",New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 5,2,S,configuration; permissions,"<p>Route-permission mappings stored in a centralized configuration and dynamically loaded by the AuthorizationMiddleware.</p>"
Task,,,,Update Authorization Middleware for Centralized Configuration,"<p>Modify the AuthorizationMiddleware to load route-permission mappings from the centralized configuration file or database.</p>",New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 6,3,S,middleware; configuration,"<p>AuthorizationMiddleware dynamically loads route-permission mappings from centralized configuration and applies them during permission checks.</p>"
Task,,,,Test Dynamic Permission Checks,"<p>Write and execute tests to ensure the dynamic permission checks are functioning correctly. Tests should cover various roles, permissions, and routes.</p>",New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 6,3,M,testing; permissions,"<p>All tests for dynamic permission checks pass, covering different scenarios of roles, permissions, and routes.</p>"
