# Pydantic Schemas

This directory contains the Pydantic schemas for the Quiz App backend.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file is currently empty but serves as a placeholder to make the `schemas` directory a Python package.

- `questions.py`: This module defines the Pydantic schemas for the Question model. It includes the following schemas:
  - `QuestionBase`: The base schema for a Question, containing the `text` attribute.
  - `QuestionCreate`: The schema for creating a Question, inheriting from `QuestionBase`.
  - `Question`: The schema representing a stored Question, inheriting from `QuestionBase` and including additional attributes such as `id` and `subtopic_id`.

- `user.py`: This module defines the Pydantic schemas for the User model. It includes the following schemas:
  - `UserBase`: The base schema for a User, containing the `username` attribute.
  - `UserCreate`: The schema for creating a User, inheriting from `UserBase` and including the `password` attribute with validation.
  - `UserLogin`: The schema for user login, containing the `username` and `password` attributes.

## Suggestions

Given the goals of the Quiz App project outlined in `/code/quiz-app/backend/README.md`, here are some suggestions for additional schemas or considerations:

- Create schemas for other models such as `Subject`, `Topic`, `Subtopic`, `AnswerChoice`, and `UserResponse`. These schemas will define the structure and validation rules for the corresponding models.

- Consider creating separate schemas for different actions or use cases related to each model. For example, you may have separate schemas for creating, updating, and retrieving questions or user responses.

- If the quiz app supports different types of questions (e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank), you may need to create schemas for each question type to handle their specific attributes and validation rules.

- To support user authentication and authorization, consider creating schemas for user registration, user profile updates, and user roles or permissions.

- If the quiz app allows users to create and share their own question sets, you may need to create schemas for user-generated content such as `UserQuestionSet` or `UserQuestion`.

- As the quiz app evolves and new features are added, you may need to create additional schemas or modify existing ones to accommodate the new data structures and validation requirements.

Remember to keep the schemas modular, focused, and aligned with the corresponding models and API endpoints. Use appropriate data types, validation rules, and constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency.

Consider using Pydantic's advanced features such as field validators, custom data types, and schema inheritance to handle complex validation scenarios and maintain code reusability.

Regularly review and update the schemas as the application evolves to ensure they accurately represent the expected input and output data structures for the quiz app's API endpoints.
