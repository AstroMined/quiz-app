# API Endpoints

This directory contains the implementation of various API endpoints for the Quiz App backend.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file serves as a central point to import and organize the various endpoint routers. It imports the router objects from each endpoint file and makes them available for use in the main FastAPI application.

- `authentication.py`: This file provides endpoints for user registration and authentication. It defines routes for user registration (`/register/`) and issuing access tokens upon successful authentication (`/token/`).

- `questions.py`: This file provides endpoints for managing question sets. It defines routes for uploading question sets in JSON format (`/upload-questions/`) and retrieving question sets from the database (`/question-set/`).

- `register.py`: This file provides an endpoint for user registration. It defines a route for registering new users (`/register/`) by validating the provided data and creating a new user in the database.

- `token.py`: This file provides an endpoint for user authentication and token generation. It defines a route for authenticating users and issuing access tokens (`/token`) upon successful authentication.

- `users.py`: This file provides a simple endpoint for retrieving user information. It defines a route for retrieving a list of users (`/users/`), which is currently hardcoded.

## Suggestions

- Consider creating separate files for each major endpoint category (e.g., `users.py`, `questions.py`, `auth.py`) to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.

- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on questions, subjects, topics, and subtopics to allow for management of the quiz content.

- Add endpoints for retrieving user-specific data, such as user profiles, quiz history, and scores.

- Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting functionality for endpoints that return lists of data to improve performance and usability.

- Consider implementing rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage.

- Explore the possibility of implementing real-time features, such as live quizzes or multiplayer functionality, using WebSocket endpoints.

- Continuously update and maintain the API documentation to ensure it remains accurate and up to date with any changes or additions to the endpoints.
