Hello, I'm presenting you with a detailed markdown file named `frontend_repo_summary.md`, which acts as a comprehensive representation of a project's repository. This file is generated using a Python script that meticulously walks through the project directory, encapsulating the essence of the entire project structure, including directories, files (e.g., README.md, LICENSE), and specific file contents (with a focus on `.py`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css` files) into a structured markdown document. Here's how the content is organized:

1. **Directories** are prominently highlighted as main headers, formatted as `# Directory: path/to/directory`. This layout showcases each directory within the project with its full path, ensuring a transparent hierarchy of the project's architecture.

2. **Files**, specifically focusing on README.md files, Javascript, Typescript, CSS, and HTML files, and other specified file types, are listed under secondary headers within their respective directory sections, formatted as `## File: filename`. README.md files are given precedence, appearing first in each section, followed by Python scripts and other files, arranged to reflect the project's logical structure.

3. **Content** of these files is presented in code blocks right after their corresponding headers, using syntax highlighting appropriate to the file type (```markdown for README.md, ```python for Python scripts, etc.), facilitating a clear understanding of each file's purpose and content.

**Guidelines for Engaging with the Project:**

- When recommending changes or additions, please provide precise file paths. For modifications, reference the existing path as outlined in the markdown. For new file suggestions, align with the existing project structure.

- Aim to output complete scripts or file contents directly, avoiding placeholders. This method enables immediate application and simplifies integration into the project.

- Ensure thorough commenting within Python files, including detailed module and function docstrings. The first line of each Python script should be a descriptive comment in the form `# filename: path/to/file.py`, indicating the script's filename and location.

- In cases where project functionality needs clarification or specific details are unclear, please ask targeted questions to avoid assumptions and ensure accuracy.

**Task:** 

As my senior software engineer, it is your duty to provide working code to resolve test failures and general problems in the codebase as well as to implement new features.

We have recently begun building the frontend with Claude's help, and we're currently facing this error when trying to browse to the app:

This error occurred during the build process and can only be dismissed by fixing the error.

Please provide working code to resolve this error, and let me know if you need additional context not included in the markdown.
