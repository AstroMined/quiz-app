Hello, I'm presenting you with a detailed markdown file named `quiz-app-backend_repo_summary.md`, which acts as a comprehensive representation of a project's repository. This file is generated using a Python script that meticulously walks through the project directory, encapsulating the essence of the entire project structure, including directories, files (e.g., README.md, LICENSE), and specific file contents (with a focus on `.py`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css` files) into a structured markdown document. Here's how the content is organized:

1. **Directories** are prominently highlighted as main headers, formatted as `# Directory: path/to/directory`. This layout showcases each directory within the project with its full path, ensuring a transparent hierarchy of the project's architecture.

2. **Files**, specifically focusing on README.md files, Python scripts, and other specified file types, are listed under secondary headers within their respective directory sections, formatted as `## File: filename`. README.md files are given precedence, appearing first in each section, followed by Python scripts and other files, arranged to reflect the project's logical structure.

3. **Content** of these files is presented in code blocks right after their corresponding headers, using syntax highlighting appropriate to the file type (```markdown for README.md, ```python for Python scripts, etc.), facilitating a clear understanding of each file's purpose and content.

**Guidelines for Engaging with the Project:**

- When recommending changes or additions, please provide precise file paths. For modifications, reference the existing path as outlined in the markdown. For new file suggestions, align with the existing project structure.

- Aim to output complete scripts or file contents directly, avoiding placeholders. This method enables immediate application and simplifies integration into the project.

- Ensure thorough commenting within Python files, including detailed module and function docstrings. The first line of each Python script should be a descriptive comment in the form `# filename: path/to/file.py`, indicating the script's filename and location.

- In cases where project functionality needs clarification or specific details are unclear, please ask targeted questions to avoid assumptions and ensure accuracy.

**[Task-Specific Guidance]:**

**Task:** 

As my senior Python engineer, it is your duty to provide working code to resolve test failures and general problems in the codebase.
In a recent code review, we modified the UserResponseCreate schema and the create_user_response_endpoint endpoint as follows:

### 1. Endpoint Adjustment:
We modified the endpoint to manually handle the instantiation of the schema and added the database session (`db`) to the data before validation. This ensured that the database session was included in the schema validation process.

**Original Endpoint:**
```python
def create_user_response_endpoint(
    user_response: UserResponseCreateSchema,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: UserModel = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    # Original code
```

**Adjusted Endpoint:**
```python
@router.post(
    "/user-responses/",
    response_model=UserResponseSchema,
    status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED
)
def create_user_response_endpoint(
    user_response_data: dict,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: UserModel = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    logger.debug("Received user response data: %s", user_response_data)

    # Add the database session to the schema data for validation
    user_response_data['db'] = db
    logger.debug("User response data after adding db: %s", user_response_data)

    # Manually create the schema instance with the updated data
    try:
        user_response = UserResponseCreateSchema(**user_response_data)
        logger.debug("Re-instantiated user response: %s", user_response)

        created_response = create_user_response_crud(db=db, user_response=user_response)
        logger.debug("User response created successfully: %s", created_response)
        return created_response
    except ValueError as e:
        logger.error("Validation error: %s", e)
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST, detail=str(e))
    except HTTPException as e:
        logger.error("Error creating user response: %s", e)
        raise HTTPException(status_code=e.status_code, detail=e.detail)
```

### 2. Logging:
We added detailed logging to trace the flow and values within the schema and endpoint. This helped identify where the `db` session might not be getting passed correctly.

**Example Logging:**
```python
logger.debug("Received user response data: %s", user_response_data)
logger.debug("User response data after adding db: %s", user_response_data)
logger.debug("Re-instantiated user response: %s", user_response)
```

### 3. Schema Modification:
We ensured the schema correctly handled the `db` session and provided logging within the validation method.

**Schema Code:**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, model_validator, Field
from typing import Optional
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class UserResponseBaseSchema(BaseModel):
    user_id: int
    question_id: int
    answer_choice_id: int
    db: Optional[Session] = Field(default=None, exclude=True)

    class Config:
        arbitrary_types_allowed = True

class UserResponseCreateSchema(UserResponseBaseSchema):
    @model_validator(mode='before')
    def validate_foreign_keys(cls, values):
        db = values.get('db')
        logger.debug("Validation values: %s", values)
        if not db:
            logger.error("Database session not provided")
            raise ValueError("Database session not provided")

        user_id = values.get('user_id')
        if not get_user_by_id_crud(db, user_id):
            logger.error("Invalid user_id: %s", user_id)
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid user_id: {user_id}")

        question_id = values.get('question_id')
        if not get_question_crud(db, question_id):
            logger.error("Invalid question_id: %s", question_id)
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid question_id: {question_id}")

        answer_choice_id = values.get('answer_choice_id')
        if not get_answer_choice_crud(db, answer_choice_id):
            logger.error("Invalid answer_choice_id: %s", answer_choice_id)
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid answer_choice_id: {answer_choice_id}")

        logger.debug("Foreign keys validated successfully")
        return values
```

### 4. Test Adjustment:
We modified the test assertions to match the actual response structure returned by the API, specifically checking for error messages within the JSON response.

**Original Test:**
```python
def test_create_user_response_invalid_data(logged_in_client, db_session):
    invalid_data = {
        "user_id": 999,
        "question_id": 999,
        "answer_choice_id": 999,
        "is_correct": True
    }
    response = logged_in_client.post("/user-responses/", json=invalid_data)
    print(response.text)
    assert response.status_code == 400
    assert response.json()["detail"] == "Invalid user_id"
```

**Adjusted Test:**
```python
def test_create_user_response_invalid_data(logged_in_client, db_session):
    invalid_data = {
        "user_id": 999,
        "question_id": 999,
        "answer_choice_id": 999,
        "is_correct": True
    }
    response = logged_in_client.post("/user-responses/", json=invalid_data)
    logger.debug("Response: %s", response.json())
    assert response.status_code == 400

    # Extract the details from the error response
    detail = response.json()["detail"]

    # Check the error message
    assert "Invalid user_id" in detail
```

### Summary:
1. **Endpoint Adjustment**: Manually handle schema instantiation and add `db` session before validation.
2. **Logging**: Added detailed logging using lazy `%` formatting to trace the flow and values within the schema and endpoint.
3. **Schema Modification**: Ensured schema handles `db` session correctly and added validation logging.
4. **Test Adjustment**: Modified test assertions to match the actual response structure and content.

These changes ensure the `db` session is correctly passed to the schema, validation errors are handled appropriately, and tests accurately reflect the new validation behavior and response format.


In our code review, we identified other schemas that should have validators added for foreign keys:

QuestionCreateSchema and QuestionUpdateSchema in app/schemas/questions.py:

Add validators for subject_id, topic_id, and subtopic_id fields to ensure they exist in their respective tables.


UserUpdateSchema in app/schemas/user.py:

Add a validator for the group_ids field to ensure the group IDs exist in the groups table.


QuestionSetCreateSchema and QuestionSetUpdateSchema in app/schemas/question_sets.py:

Add validators for question_ids and group_ids fields to ensure they exist in their respective tables.


LeaderboardSchema in app/schemas/leaderboard.py:

Add validators for user_id and group_id fields to ensure they exist in their respective tables.

We also identified the endpoints that need to be adjusted to pass the db session to the validators:

create_question_endpoint in app/api/endpoints/question.py:

Update the function signature to include db: Session = Depends(get_db).
Pass the db session to the QuestionCreateSchema validator


update_question_endpoint in app/api/endpoints/question.py:

Update the function signature to include db: Session = Depends(get_db).
Pass the db session to the QuestionUpdateSchema validator

update_user_me in app/api/endpoints/users.py:

Pass the db session to the UserUpdateSchema validator


create_question_set_endpoint in app/api/endpoints/question_sets.py:

Pass the db session to the QuestionSetCreateSchema validator

update_question_set_endpoint in app/api/endpoints/question_sets.py:

Pass the db session to the QuestionSetUpdateSchema validator

get_leaderboard in app/api/endpoints/leaderboard.py:

Pass the db session to the LeaderboardSchema validator
