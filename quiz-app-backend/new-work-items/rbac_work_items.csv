Epic,Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation,,,,"<p>Implement a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions dynamically, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and security. This includes middleware for permission checks, database models for roles and permissions, and CRUD operations for managing them.</p>",New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 4,1,XL,RBAC; backend; security,<p>Middleware for dynamic permission checks implemented.</p><p>Database models for roles and permissions created.</p><p>CRUD operations for roles and permissions available.</p><p>Routes and permissions mappings stored in a configuration file or database.</p>
Feature,,Authorization Middleware,,,<p>Develop an AuthorizationMiddleware to handle permission checks dynamically before requests reach the endpoints. The middleware should validate if the user has the required permissions based on the route and HTTP method.</p>,New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 4,1,L,middleware; security; permissions,<p>Middleware intercepts requests and checks permissions.</p><p>Middleware raises HTTP 403 if the user lacks required permissions.</p><p>Middleware supports route and HTTP method-based permission checks.</p>
User Story,,,Dynamic Role and Permission Management,,"<p>Implement a system to store roles and permissions in the database, allowing for dynamic management without modifying the codebase. This includes creating models, schemas, and CRUD functions for roles and permissions.</p>",New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 4,1,L,roles; permissions; database,<p>Models for roles and permissions created.</p><p>Schemas for roles and permissions serialization and deserialization implemented.</p><p>CRUD functions for managing roles and permissions available.</p><p>Many-to-many relationship between roles and permissions established.</p>
Task,,,,Create Role and Permission Models,"<p>Create database models for roles and permissions, including fields for name and description, and establish a many-to-many relationship between them.</p>",New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 4,1,M,models; database,<p>RoleModel and PermissionModel with appropriate fields created.</p><p>Many-to-many relationship between RoleModel and PermissionModel established.</p>
Task,,,,Implement CRUD Functions for Roles and Permissions,"<p>Develop CRUD functions to create, read, update, and delete roles and permissions in the database.</p>",New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 5,2,M,CRUD; database,"<p>Functions to create, read, update, and delete roles implemented.</p><p>Functions to create, read, update, and delete permissions implemented.</p><p>Unit tests for CRUD functions created.</p>"
Task,,,,Develop Role and Permission Schemas,<p>Implement schemas for serializing and deserializing role and permission data for API interactions.</p>,New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 5,2,M,schemas; serialization,<p>RoleSchema and PermissionSchema created.</p><p>Schemas support necessary fields for API interactions.</p>
Task,,,,Configure Route-Permission Mappings,<p>Store route-permission mappings in a configuration file or database to enable dynamic permission checks.</p>,New,Quiz App Backend,Sprint 6,2,S,configuration; permissions,<p>Route-permission mappings stored in a configuration file or database.</p><p>Middleware dynamically loads route-permission mappings.</p>
