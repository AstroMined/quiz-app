# Tests

This directory contains the test files for the Quiz App backend.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file is currently empty but serves as a placeholder to make the `tests` directory a Python package.

- `conftest.py`: This module defines pytest fixtures for testing the Quiz App backend. It includes fixtures for creating a test database session, a FastAPI test client, and a test user.

- `test_auth.py`: This module contains tests for user authentication. It covers scenarios such as successful authentication, failed authentication, and authentication with missing credentials.

- `test_registration.py`: This module contains tests for user registration. It covers scenarios such as successful registration, registration with existing username, registration with invalid data, and registration with empty data.

## Suggestions

Given the goals of the Quiz App project outlined in `/code/quiz-app/quiz-app-backend/README.md`, here are some suggestions for additional test files or considerations:

- Create test files for other API endpoints and functionality, such as question management, user responses, filtering, and randomization. These tests should cover various scenarios, including success cases, error handling, and edge cases.

- Consider creating separate test files for different models and CRUD operations. For example, you may have `test_questions.py`, `test_subjects.py`, `test_user_responses.py`, etc., to test the functionality related to each model.

- If the quiz app supports different types of questions (e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank), create test files to cover the specific behavior and validation for each question type.

- Write tests for user authentication and authorization, including token generation, token validation, and access control for protected endpoints.

- Create integration tests to verify the interaction between different components of the backend, such as the API endpoints, database operations, and external services (if any).

- Consider writing tests for edge cases, error scenarios, and input validation to ensure the robustness and reliability of the backend.

- If the quiz app has complex business logic or algorithms (e.g., question randomization, scoring), create separate test files to thoroughly test those components.

- As new features or modifications are introduced to the backend, make sure to update the existing tests and add new tests to cover the changes.

Remember to follow best practices for testing, such as using meaningful test names, maintaining test independence, and covering both positive and negative scenarios.

Regularly run the test suite to ensure that the backend functionality remains intact and to catch any regressions or bugs introduced by code changes.

Consider integrating the tests into your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automatically run the tests whenever changes are made to the codebase.

Keep the tests maintainable, readable, and up to date with the evolving requirements of the quiz app backend.
