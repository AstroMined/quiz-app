# Database Management

This directory contains modules related to database management and session handling for the Quiz App backend.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file is currently empty but serves as a placeholder to make the `db` directory a Python package.

- `base.py`: This module defines the base class for SQLAlchemy models. It provides a declarative base class (`Base`) that can be used to create database models.

- `session.py`: This module provides database session management. It includes the following:
  - `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL`: A variable that holds the database connection URL. It is currently set to use SQLite for development, but it should be adjusted for production.
  - `engine`: A SQLAlchemy engine instance created using the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL`.
  - `SessionLocal`: A SQLAlchemy session factory created using the `engine`.
  - `init_db() -> None`: A function that initializes the database by creating all the tables defined in the models.
  - `get_db() -> SessionLocal`: A function that creates a new database session and closes it when the request is finished. It is typically used as a dependency in FastAPI routes to provide a database session to the route handlers.

## Suggestions

Given the goals of the Quiz App project outlined in `/code/quiz-app/quiz-app-backend/README.md`, here are some suggestions for additional files or purposes of empty files in this directory:

- Consider adding a configuration file (e.g., `config.py`) to store database-related configuration settings, such as the database connection URL, database driver, and any additional database-specific settings. This file can be used to centralize the database configuration and make it easier to switch between different database systems or environments.

- If the project requires database migrations, you can add a migrations directory (e.g., `migrations/`) to store the migration files. Tools like Alembic can be used to manage database migrations, allowing you to version control your database schema and easily apply changes to the database.

- If there are common database queries or operations that are used across multiple parts of the application, consider creating a separate module (e.g., `queries.py`) to store these reusable queries. This module can provide a centralized place for defining and organizing commonly used database queries, improving code reusability and maintainability.

- As the project grows and the database schema becomes more complex, you may want to consider splitting the models into separate files based on their entity or domain. This can help keep the model definitions organized and easier to manage.

- If the application requires custom database types or extensions, you can create separate modules (e.g., `custom_types.py`) to define and register these custom types with SQLAlchemy.

Remember to keep the database-related modules focused on database management, session handling, and model definitions. Business logic and data manipulation should be handled in separate layers of the application, such as in the CRUD modules or service layers.
