# Core Package

This directory contains the core modules and functionality for the Quiz App backend.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file serves as the main entry point for the core package. It can be used to perform any necessary initialization or configuration for the core package.

- `auth.py`: This file provides authentication-related functionality for the Quiz App backend. It defines the OAuth2 authentication scheme and can be extended to include additional authentication mechanisms or utilities.

- `config.py`: This file provides configuration settings for the Quiz App backend. It can be used to define and manage various configuration options, such as database settings, API keys, or other environment-specific variables.

- `jwt.py`: This file provides JWT (JSON Web Token) related functionality for the Quiz App backend. It includes functions for creating and verifying JWT access tokens, as well as managing token expiration and other JWT-related operations.

- `security.py`: This file provides security-related utilities for the Quiz App backend. It includes functions for password hashing and verification using the bcrypt algorithm.

## Suggestions

- Consider adding more granular configuration options in the `config.py` file to allow for better customization and flexibility of the backend settings.

- Implement additional authentication mechanisms, such as API key authentication or social login, to provide multiple ways for users to authenticate with the backend.

- Explore the use of refresh tokens in addition to access tokens to enhance security and provide a better user experience for long-lived sessions.

- Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms in the core package to protect against excessive or abusive requests to the backend.

- Consider adding logging functionality to the core package to capture important events, errors, and metrics for monitoring and debugging purposes.

- Regularly update and maintain the dependencies used in the core package to ensure the latest security patches and bug fixes are applied.

- Implement robust error handling and exception management in the core package to provide meaningful error responses to clients and maintain the stability of the backend.

- Continuously review and improve the security measures implemented in the core package to protect against common vulnerabilities and threats.
