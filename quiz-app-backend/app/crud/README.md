# CRUD Operations

This directory contains modules that provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for various entities in the Quiz App backend.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: This file is currently empty but serves as a placeholder to make the `crud` directory a Python package.

- `crud_question_sets.py`: This module provides CRUD operations for question sets. It includes the following functions:
  - `create_question_set(db: Session, question_set: QuestionSetCreate) -> QuestionSet`: Create a new question set.
  - `get_question_sets(db: Session, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100) -> List[QuestionSet]`: Retrieve a list of question sets.
  - `update_question_set(db: Session, question_set_id: int, question_set: QuestionSetUpdate) -> QuestionSet`: Update a question set.
  - `delete_question_set(db: Session, question_set_id: int) -> bool`: Delete a question set.

- `crud_user.py`: This module provides CRUD operations for users. It includes the following functions:
  - `create_user(db: Session, user: UserCreate) -> User`: Create a new user.
  - `get_user_by_username(db: Session, username: str) -> User`: Retrieve a user by username.
  - `authenticate_user(db: Session, username: str, password: str) -> User`: Authenticate a user.
  - `remove_user(db: Session, user_id: int) -> User`: Remove a user.

## Suggestions

Given the goals of the Quiz App project outlined in `/code/quiz-app/quiz-app-backend/README.md`, here are some suggestions for additional files or purposes of empty files in this directory:

- Consider creating separate CRUD modules for other entities such as subjects, topics, subtopics, and user responses. This would provide a more modular and organized approach to handle CRUD operations for each entity.

- The empty `__init__.py` file serves as a placeholder to make the `crud` directory a Python package. It can be used to import and re-export the CRUD functions from the individual modules, providing a cleaner and more convenient way to access them from other parts of the application.

- As the project grows, you may need to add more CRUD operations or extend the existing ones to support additional functionality or filtering options. Keep the CRUD modules focused on database operations and separate the business logic and validation into separate service or utility modules.

- Consider adding error handling and proper error responses in the CRUD functions to handle scenarios such as invalid data, resource not found, or database errors. This will help in providing meaningful error messages to the API consumers.

- If there are common database queries or operations that are used across multiple CRUD modules, consider extracting them into a separate utility module to avoid duplication and promote code reuse.

Remember to keep the CRUD modules simple, focused, and maintainable. They should only be responsible for performing database operations, while the business logic and validation should be handled in separate layers of the application.
