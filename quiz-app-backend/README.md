# Quiz App Backend Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for completing the backend of the Quiz App project using FastAPI. The project aims to provide a comprehensive system for user account management, question set uploads, and dynamic learning tools.

## Development Roadmap

Below is a roadmap for the remaining development tasks, organized into checkbox format for easy tracking.

### User Account Management
- [ ] **JWT-based Authentication**: Implement JWT for secure user session management. This includes registration, login, and logout functionalities.
  - **Files involved**: `auth.py` (to be created), `models.py` (update user model), `dependencies.py` (for JWT token verification).
- [ ] **User Registration**: Allow new users to register by providing necessary details.
  - **Files involved**: `auth.py`, `schemas.py` (for user schema), `crud.py` (for database operations).
- [ ] **User Login and Logout**: Enable users to log in and securely log out.
  - **Files involved**: `auth.py`, `schemas.py`, `crud.py`.

### Question Set Management
- [ ] **Question Set Uploads**: Enable users to upload question sets in JSON format.
  - **Files involved**: `question_sets.py` (to be created), `models.py` (update for question set model), `schemas.py` (for question set schema).
- [ ] **Database Storage**: Use SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production to store question sets.
  - **Files involved**: `database.py` (configure databases), `models.py`.
- [ ] **Public/Private Question Sets**: Allow users to mark question sets as public or private.
  - **Files involved**: `question_sets.py`, `models.py`.

### Filtering and Randomization
- [ ] **Filtering Options**: Provide filtering capabilities for questions by subject, topic, subtopic, and status.
  - **Files involved**: `filters.py` (to be created), `models.py`.
- [ ] **Randomization Logic**: Implement logic to randomize questions and their answer choices.
  - **Files involved**: `randomization.py` (to be created).

### Response Tracking
- [ ] **Track User Answers**: Design a system to record user answers, including timestamps and correctness.
  - **Files involved**: `responses.py` (to be created), `models.py` (update for response model), `schemas.py` (for response schema).

### API Endpoints
- [ ] **RESTful Endpoints**: Develop endpoints for user management, question set CRUD operations, filtering, and response submissions.
  - **Files involved**: `main.py`, `auth.py`, `question_sets.py`, `filters.py`, `responses.py`.
- [ ] **Swagger Documentation**: Utilize FastAPI's Swagger UI to document these endpoints.
  - **Files involved**: Automatically generated by FastAPI, but ensure all endpoint functions have appropriate docstrings.

### Security Considerations
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Ensure all inputs are properly validated to prevent injection attacks.
  - **Files involved**: All endpoint-related files.
- [ ] **CORS Configuration**: Configure CORS appropriately to secure the API.
  - **Files involved**: `main.py`.

### Extra Features (Optional)
- [ ] **Scoring System**: Explore adding a scoring system or leaderboard.
  - **Files involved**: `scoring.py` (to be created), `models.py`, `schemas.py`.
- [ ] **Review Mode**: Implement a review mode for questions answered incorrectly.
  - **Files involved**: `review.py` (to be created), `models.py`.
