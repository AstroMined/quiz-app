To craft an effective prompt template for maximizing utility from the `repo_summary.md` you'll provide as context to an LLM, it's crucial to structure the prompt clearly and provide detailed instructions about the format and expectations. Below is a comprehensive template that follows your guidelines:

**Prompt Template for Utilizing `repo_summary.md` in LLM Interactions:**

---

Hello, I'm providing you with a markdown file named `repo_summary.md` that serves as a single file representation of a project repository. This file organizes the content of an entire project repository, including various Python scripts and README.md files, into a structured markdown document. Here's how the file is structured:

1. **Directories** are marked as main headers, formatted as `# Directory: path/to/directory`. Each directory within the project is listed with its full path, providing a clear hierarchy of the project's structure.

2. **Files** within those directories, including Python scripts and README.md files, are listed under secondary headers within their respective directory sections, formatted as `## File: filename`. README.md files, when present, are prioritized and appear first under each directory section, followed by Python scripts.

3. **Content** of each file is enclosed in code blocks immediately following the file header, using the appropriate syntax highlighting (```markdown for README.md and ```python for Python scripts).

When recommending changes or additions to the project, please specify the exact file paths. If suggesting modifications to existing files, reference the file path as noted in the markdown structure. For new file suggestions, specify a proposed file path consistent with the project's organizational structure.

Please output full scripts or file content whenever possible, without using placeholders. This approach ensures ease of use and allows for straightforward copy/pasting of the generated code into the project.

If there are aspects of the functionality you need to clarify or if you're unsure about how certain parts of the project are intended to work, please ask specific questions rather than making assumptions or "hallucinating" details.

**[Task-Specific Section]:**

*Here, I'm seeking assistance with the following tasks for my project:*

[**Your tasks here** - Be as specific as possible about what you need the LLM to help with, whether it's debugging a specific script, suggesting improvements for performance, adding new functionality, or rewriting sections for clarity. If there are particular constraints or requirements (e.g., compatibility, performance), mention them here.]

This template is designed to provide a clear, structured interaction with the LLM, ensuring it understands the organization of your project and the format of the `repo_summary.md` file. By specifying tasks and expectations clearly, you'll help the LLM provide targeted, useful contributions to your project.
